Evolving concepts to open digital books

1. <a href="https://guide.pressbooks.com">Pressbooks</a>: a Wordpress based digital publishing tool used by <a href="https://www.publiconsulting.com/wordpress">publiconsulting media</a> to publish digital interactive editions using the annotation tool <a href="https://web.hypothes.is">Hypothesis</a> to let readers annotate the text directly on screen.

2. <a href="https://gettypubs.github.io/quire/">Quire</a>: a static-site generator platform developed by <a href="https://www.getty.edu/publications/digital/platforms-tools.html">Getty Publications</a> a new publishing tool—optimized for publication discoverability and longevity—that uses a static-site generator, Hugo, to create and output titles in multiple formats from plain text files. E-book files are distribution-ready for Amazon, Apple, and other vendors; PDF files are print-on-demand ready. And the online edition can be hosted on any web server, with no special configurations or installations necessary and no backend databases or content management system to update and support over the long term.

3. <a href="https://bookdown.org">Bookdown</a>: an open-source R package built on top of R Markdown to make it really easy to write books and long-form articles/reports. Markdown is a very simple language but made powerful thanks to Pandoc, and bookdown has added a few important missing features related to writing books, such as figure/table caption numbering and cross-references, and embedding HTML widgets or Shiny apps. Output formats: PDF, HTML, and EPUB, etc.
